# OpenAI_Chat-Flutter_App
This sample code provides a basic UI for a chat app where you can enter a message and send it to the OpenAI API to get a response. The response is then displayed on the screen. Additionally, there is a button which redirects to another screen where you can use DALL-E Image Generator.
