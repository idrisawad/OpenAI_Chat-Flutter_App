# OpenAI_Chat-Flutter_App

This sample code is written in Dart,  provides a basic UI for a chat app where you can enter a message and send it to the OpenAI API to get a response. The response is then displayed on the screen. Additionally, there is a button which redirects to another screen where you can use DALL-E Image Generator.

Note that this is a basic example, and you will likely want to add additional functionality and error handling to a production app.

How to use this code in Android Studio

First, make sure you have the latest version of Flutter and Dart installed on your computer.
Open Android Studio and create a new Flutter project.
Replace the existing main.dart file in the lib folder with the code provided above.
In the pubspec.yaml file, make sure to add the http package as a dependency:

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.12.2
```
Save the changes and click on the Packages get button in the top right corner of the editor to install the dependency.
Run the project by clicking on the Run button in the top right corner of the editor or by using the shortcut Shift + F10

IntelliJ or Gradle?

IntelliJ is the default build system for Flutter projects in Android Studio, and it's the one that is recommended by the Flutter team. IntelliJ is a lightweight build system that is easy to use and provides a smooth development experience.

Gradle, on the other hand, is a more powerful and flexible build system that is used by Android Studio for native Android app development. It provides more advanced features such as building multiple variants of your app and configuring custom build tasks.

In summary, you can use either IntelliJ or Gradle to create the new file for this code. However, IntelliJ is recommended as it is the default build system for Flutter projects in Android Studio and it provides a smooth development experience.
